<h3>The role of the housekeeper or EVS technician is critical to the control and prevention of infections in the hospital or other healthcare facilities where they may be employed.</h3>
<div class='col-sm-12'>
   <p>Bacteria can survive in dust and on bedrails, phones, nurse call buttons, curtains and other surfaces for long periods. Hand hygiene is important for all healthcare workers, but without a clean environment, clean hands will quickly become re-contaminated.</p>
   <p>Add to this the fact that antibiotic – resistant bacteria (“super bugs”) have been unleashed in hospitals and they can survive on common touch-points for up to 56 or more days, makes this issue even more concerning.</p>
   <p>In order to reduce the number of infections in the facility, it is extremely important that EVS technicians understand their role, proper cleaning procedures and the soaps or chemical solutions they use for cleaning.</p>
   <p>The purpose of this course is to teach the essential elements of the EVS technician’s job--with special attention to infection prevention and control aspects.</p>
   <p>At the end of this course, you as a certified EVS technician will be able to explain how performing your routine tasks and help create a safe, clean and disinfected environment, where the spread of infections and disease is prevented or controlled, in a healthcare environment.</p>
   <h3>This will be done by covering the following topics and more:</h3>
   <ul>
      <li>A glossary of terms related to cleaning and disinfection</li>
      <li>A general understanding of infection prevention/control principles</li>
      <li>The “Chain of Infection” explained; how proper cleaning and disinfection of environmental surfaces breaks the chain of infection</li>
      <li>Answering the question of “How are infectious diseases spread?”</li>
      <li>How to work safely in a healthcare environment; Personal Protection Equipment (PPE) and proper Handwashing</li>
      <li>How to avoid cross-contamination</li>
      <li>Understanding Bloodborne pathogens, the risks, and how to protect yourself from possible exposure</li>
      <li>Biological hazards on the job (i.e., body fluids)</li>
      <li>A tutorial on disinfectants and how to use them effectively</li>
      <li>Steps of Daily Processing</li>
      <li>Terminal or Discharge Processing</li>
      <li>Some simple instructions for cleaning and disinfecting the items encountered while performing a daily assignment</li>
      <li>Relating to patients, visitors and staff.</li>
   </ul>
   <h3>“One well-trained, conscientious housekeeper,<br>given the right tools and enough time to do their job,<br>will prevent more disease than a room full of doctors can cure.”</h3>
